### **To utilize this feature effectively,**

### **Formulate your question clearly and concisely:**

1. Be specific about the information you're seeking. For example, instead of asking "What's new?", try "Are there any new updates regarding the marketing campaign?" or "Is the website experiencing any downtime?"

2. Use keywords related to your business and the specific area you're interested in.

### **Ask direct questions:**

1. The more direct your question, the more accurate and relevant the AI's response will be.

2. Avoid vague or ambiguous inquiries.

### **Utilize follow-up questions:**

1. If the initial response from AI is insufficient, ask follow-up questions to refine the information.

2. For example, "Can you provide more details on \[specific topic]?" or "Are there any links to relevant documentation?"

**Example:**

Instead of manually searching for updates on a recent software release, a user can simply ask the chatbot: "What are the key features of the latest software release?" The AI will then provide a concise summary of the new features.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively utilize the "Ask AI" feature to streamline your information gathering process and stay informed about your business.
